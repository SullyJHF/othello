        "@playwright/mcp@latest",
        "--isolated",
        "--allowed-origins", "http://localhost:3000",
        "--timeout", "30000"
      ],
      "env": {
        "PLAYWRIGHT_HEADLESS": "false"

    }
  }
}
```

**Security Considerations:**
- **Origin Restriction**: Limit browser access to specific development origins
- **Isolated Context**: Use isolated browser contexts for safety
- **Timeout Limits**: Set reasonable timeout limits for automation
- **Data Protection**: Ensure no sensitive data is exposed during automation

#### 9.4.2 Best Practices
**Browser Automation:**
- **Element Identification**: Use stable selectors for reliable interactions
- **State Management**: Properly manage browser state between interactions
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling for automation failures
- **Resource Cleanup**: Properly clean up browser resources after use

**Performance Optimization:**
- **Selective Screenshots**: Take screenshots only when needed
- **Efficient Waiting**: Use appropriate waiting strategies for dynamic content
- **Resource Management**: Monitor and manage browser resource usage
- **Automation Speed**: Balance automation speed with reliability

# Playwright MCP Integration Guide

## Quick Start
1. Install Playwright MCP: `claude mcp add playwright npx @playwright/mcp@latest`
2. Start your development server: `npm start`
3. Ask Claude to interact with your application: "Use playwright to navigate to the game and take a screenshot"

## Common Commands
- "Take a screenshot of the current game state"
- "Navigate to the debug panel and enable auto-play"
- "Check how the game looks on mobile viewport"
- "Interact with the game board and capture the result"

## Debugging Scenarios
- Game board state inspection
- UI layout debugging
- Responsive design validation
- Debug panel functionality verification
- Performance monitoring
```

#### 9.5.2 Usage Examples
**Debugging Workflow:**
```typescript
// Example debugging session with Claude
/*
1. "Use playwright to open localhost:3000 and take a screenshot"
2. "Click on the debug mode button and capture the resulting state"
3. "Make a move at position (2,3) and show me the board update"
4. "Test the auto-play functionality and capture screenshots"
5. "Switch to mobile view and verify the responsive design"
*/
```

## Technical Considerations

### Database Design

#### Core Database Schema (PostgreSQL)
- **User Management**: Authentication, profiles, preferences, and settings
- **Game Persistence**: Complete game state, move history, and metadata
- **Game Statistics**: Player performance, ELO ratings, and analytics
- **Chat and Messaging**: In-game chat, private messages, and moderation
- **Tournament Management**: Tournament structures, brackets, and results

#### Real-time Game State (Redis)
- **Active Game Cache**: Fast access to current game states
- **User Session Tracking**: Active connections and multi-device support
- **Game Room Management**: Real-time player connections and spectators
- **Move Validation Cache**: Pre-calculated valid moves for performance

#### Game Lifecycle Management
- **Game Persistence Strategy**: Automatic saving of game states to PostgreSQL
- **Memory Management**: Smart cleanup of completed games from Redis
- **Archive System**: Historical game storage with configurable retention
- **Cleanup Automation**: Scheduled tasks for data lifecycle management

**Database Tables:**
```sql
-- Core game persistence
games (id, created_at, updated_at, status, winner_id, moves_json, final_board_state)
game_players (game_id, user_id, piece_color, joined_at, left_at)
game_moves (id, game_id, player_id, position, timestamp, captured_pieces)

-- User game tracking
user_active_games (user_id, game_id, last_accessed, is_current_turn)
user_game_history (user_id, game_id, outcome, rating_change, completed_at)

-- Cleanup and archival
game_cleanup_jobs (id, game_id, scheduled_for, cleanup_type, status)
archived_games (original_game_id, archived_at, storage_location, metadata_json)
```

#### Game Cleanup System
**Automated Cleanup Features:**
- **Completed Game Cleanup**: Remove finished games from Redis after configurable delay (default: 1 hour)
- **Abandoned Game Detection**: Identify and clean up games with no activity (default: 24 hours)
- **Memory Optimization**: Periodic cleanup of stale game data and unused connections
- **Database Archival**: Move old completed games to archive tables (configurable: 30/90/365 days)
- **User Session Cleanup**: Remove inactive user sessions and stale connections

**Cleanup Configuration:**
```typescript
interface CleanupConfig {
  completedGameRetention: number;    // Hours to keep completed games in memory
  abandonedGameTimeout: number;      // Hours before marking games as abandoned
  archivalThreshold: number;         // Days before archiving completed games
  sessionTimeout: number;            // Minutes of inactivity before session cleanup
  cleanupInterval: number;           // Minutes between cleanup job runs
}
```

**Implementation:**
- **Background Jobs**: Scheduled cleanup tasks using node-cron or similar
