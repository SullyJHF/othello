// Debug game board state
await playwright.navigate("http://localhost:3000");
await playwright.click("[data-testid='debug-mode']");
await playwright.screenshot("debug-mode-active.png");

// Interact with debug controls
await playwright.click("[data-testid='debug-panel-toggle']");
await playwright.fill("[data-testid='auto-play-speed']", "5");
await playwright.click("[data-testid='auto-play-start']");

// Monitor auto-play behavior
await playwright.waitForTimeout(3000);
await playwright.screenshot("auto-play-in-progress.png");
```

#### 9.3.2 Feature Validation
**UI Feature Verification:**
```typescript
// Verify responsive design
await playwright.setViewportSize({ width: 375, height: 667 });
await playwright.navigate("http://localhost:3000");
await playwright.screenshot("mobile-view.png");

// Check desktop layout
await playwright.setViewportSize({ width: 1920, height: 1080 });

const performanceMetrics = await playwright.evaluate(() => {
  return {
    loadTime: performance.timing.loadEventEnd - performance.timing.navigationStart,
    domContentLoaded: performance.timing.domContentLoadedEventEnd - performance.timing.navigationStart,
    firstPaint: performance.getEntriesByType('paint')[0]?.startTime || 0
  };
});
```

### 9.4 Security & Best Practices

#### 9.4.1 Security Configuration
**Secure MCP Setup:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "@playwright/mcp@latest",
        "--isolated",
        "--allowed-origins", "http://localhost:3000",
        "--timeout", "30000"
      ],
      "env": {
        "PLAYWRIGHT_HEADLESS": "false"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Security Considerations:**
- **Origin Restriction**: Limit browser access to specific development origins
- **Isolated Context**: Use isolated browser contexts for safety
- **Timeout Limits**: Set reasonable timeout limits for automation
- **Data Protection**: Ensure no sensitive data is exposed during automation

#### 9.4.2 Best Practices
